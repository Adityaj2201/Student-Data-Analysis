What is DATA VISUALIZATION?
The process of presenting information in graphical formats to help people understand and understand data trends, relationships, and patterns is known as data visualization. Analysts, researchers, and decision-makers can gain insights, spot patterns, effectively communicate findings, and make data-driven decisions by using charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements to turn complex datasets into understandable and informative representations.

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that enables users to create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports Python, R, and Julia, allowing interactive data analysis, numerical simulations, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Popular for its versatility and collaboration.
